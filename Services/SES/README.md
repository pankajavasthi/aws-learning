# Sending emails

AWS SES is a service for sending emails without bothering about setting up a SMTP server. Also, we don't need to worry about high availability, scalability, licensing, upgrading and patching up the SMTP server.

1. `SendBulkEmail.java` is program which takes the list of emails and the email templates as the input and sends out emails in bulk. The same can be used for marketing, sales and promotion.
